This is an example of an ExtJS component that interacts with node.js and mongodb.

I use mongoose as the ORM and Express as the application framework on top of node.js.  

I use the ruby tool sprockets to keep my javascript cleanly organized.

You should have node.js and npm already installed.

install sprockets: gem install sprockets

install socket.io: npm install http://cl.ly/2dgx/content
install redis-client: npm install http://github.com/technoweenie/redis-node-client/tarball/npm
install mongoose: npm install mongoose
install haml: npm install haml
