This is an example of an ExtJS component that interacts with node.js and mongodb.

I use mongoose as the ORM and Express as the application framework on top of node.js.  

I use the ruby tool sprockets to keep my javascript cleanly organized.

You should have node.js and npm already installed.

To get all of the dependencies:

#for javascript tools
gem install sprockets

#socket.io for websockets abstraction
npm install http://cl.ly/2dgx/content

#redis client, for socket.io pub/sub
npm install http://github.com/technoweenie/redis-node-client/tarball/npm

#express, mongoose, haml, etc
npm install express
npm install mongoose
npm install haml

to run the server:

node app.js
